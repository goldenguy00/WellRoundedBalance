# Introducing Well-Rounded Balance (WRB)
Are you tired of repetitive runs or RoR2's unbalanced gameplay? WRB is a mod that rebalances almost the entire game, in a similar fashion to CU0-CU4, but with vast improvements. For a full list of changes, check out the WRB Google Doc.

Please note that the following mods are likely to be incompatible with WRB:
- RiskyMod
- EliteReworks
- FlatItemBuff
- Hex3Reworks
- SacrificeTweaks
- VanillaRebalance

You may be able to get them working by adjusting the config, but we will not provide special compatibility for them. The mod is currently balanced around vanilla, but we plan to add compatibility for item mods in the future.

If any of these changes seem suspicious, you likely don't have the context of what the mod does in other aspects. This is just an overview; it's better to play it first, then judge. We don't care about your negative feedback without actually trying the mod.

And of course, the mod is still in its early days, so it's bound to change. We also have a pretty expansive config that will feature more options as time goes on.

## List of Changes
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uP1Bp4tBOMoKyhyjuvXk5IHuuV373sa77NsX-l_vUUA/

## Scaling Reworks
Scaling is now linear but more aggressive, meaning it will be faster in the early game and cool off slightly during loops. This is intended to encourage players to play efficiently and make the game more engaging. The difficulty now actually scales with time, and the director spawns more enemies at a much faster pace. Gold scaling has also been heavily reworked, so you can't just kill a few enemies and buy out the whole stage. Pre-spawned enemies now give gold as well.

## Major Item Reworks
There are too many to list here, so please check the google doc for more information.

## Bazaar Reworks
There are now four lunar pods where the items were previously, along with a table containing two random Heresy items that no longer appear in the normal lunar pool. The slab (lunar reroller) has been removed, as it no longer serves a purpose.

## Elite Reworks
Elites now only have increased health (4x for T1 and 6x for T2) and much more pronounced, unique, and interesting effects. They no longer have increased damage. Check the WRB Google Doc for more information.

## Interactable Reworks
- Lunar pods now drop a lunar potential with a choice between 2 non-Heresy items when opened.
- Void cradles no longer deal 50% of your max health in damage, but instead give you a choice between **3** void items if you have a **corruptible item**, and give curse worth 10% of your maximum health for the rest of the stage. They also explode after activating the teleporter.
- Scrappers have been made rarer and much more limited, but printers are now more common and consistent.
- Scavenger bags now drop fewer items.
- Category chests no longer have increased prices, and interactables as a whole have been made more limited to prevent getting "roosted".

## Mechanic Reworks
There are too many to list here, so please check the google doc for more information.

## Smaller Features
The mod integrates some smaller mods to give players the intended, better experience, such as:
- BetterMeteorite
- BetterSpite
- ExchangeChanges
- FixKjaroRunald
- Fix Playercount
- GoldChestForAll
- LunarWispFalloff
- PingOrdering
- ShurikenFix
- SnappierStalks

This means you don't need to have these installed with Well Rounded Balance enabled.
