            // Saw? Saw!? You want me to use that skill??? No, I'll stick to double nailgun thank you very much. Mul-t isnt a melee character, dont try to make him one. Saw is stupid, barely any damage and it makes you basically guaranteed to get hit. Because. Its. Melee. Rebar? Maybe. Scrap even I would take over that garbage excuse of a skill. If you think saw is good, you are a gesture spamming, merc loving, sacrifice farming, worthless waste of oxygen and you deserve to know it. If saw was even, in any way, viable, woolie would have mentioned it. But did woolie mention it??? NO. and woolie is always right, look at his tierlists for goodness sake. I would sooner play commando than mul-t with saw, and commando is at the literal BOTTOM of woolies character tierlist. Saw literally might as well be the same as not taking an m1 at all. It only does 100% damage per hit. Nailgun does 840% DPS! why does this skill even exist. 100% damage per hit is extremely low compared to literally any other primary. Yeah, sure you can sprint while using saw. But you know what else you can sprint while using? Retool.  And retool is completely useless, the optimal mul-t loadout is literally 2 of the same skill anyway. Why would you ever swap them. So next time you try to explain to me, convince, even make me CONSIDER taking the worst m1 in the game, maybe just go and play your command/sac/swarms game instead. A melee ability on a character who isnt loader? Literally never going to work.
